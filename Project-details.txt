3) Knight's Tour Problem Solver (for different sizes – n should be selected by the user) 
using the Backtracking Search Algorithm, AND the Cultural Algorithm. 
The Knight’s Tour is a captivating chess problem where the challenge is to find a sequence of moves for a knight
to visit every square on the chessboard exactly once. This project, "Knight’s Tour Problem Solver," aims to
develop a software solution that efficiently solves the intriguing Knight’s Tour problem using two distinct
approaches: the Backtracking Search Algorithm and a Cultural Algorithm.
Problem Overview:  In the Knight’s Tour, the knight, a chess piece capable of unique L-shaped moves, must
traverse the chessboard, covering each square precisely once. The problem is both combinatorial and
algorithmic, requiring strategic exploration to determine a viable sequence of knight moves. 
Approaches: 
(a) Backtracking Search Algorithm: Backtracking involves systematically exploring potential moves while
intelligently abandoning paths that lead to dead ends. This algorithm efficiently navigates the knight
through the chessboard.  The Backtracking Search Algorithm is a systematic and resource-efficient
method for solving the Knight’s Tour. It optimises exploration by discarding unfruitful paths, ensuring a
feasible solution. 
(b) Cultural Algorithm: The Cultural Algorithm (CA) is an evolutionary computation technique (similar to
the Genetic Algorithm) that mimics the dual inheritance found in human societies, where both genetic
(population-level) evolution and cultural (knowledge-based) evolution occur in tandem. In CA, two
primary spaces are maintained: 
- Population Space: This is similar to conventional evolutionary algorithms, where a set of
candidate solutions (individuals) evolves using operators like selection, crossover, and mutation.
- Belief Space: This space stores accumulated knowledge (or “culture”) from previous
generations. It guides the search process by influencing how new candidates are generated. 
The algorithm adapts over successive generations to find an optimal knight’s tour. Cultural Algorithms
adopt a stochastic, adaptive approach to solving the Knight’s Tour. By exploring diverse move sequences
and evolving over generations, the algorithm aims to discover effective paths.
Requirements: 
User-Selected Board Size: An additional feature of this project is user customisation. Users can select
the size of the chessboard (n), allowing them to explore the Knight’s Tour for different board dimensions.
This flexibility enhances the project’s applicability and provides users with a tailored experience. 
Interactive Interface: Develop a user-friendly interface that allows users to enter the chessboard size (n)
and visualise the knight’s tour solutions.
Backtracking Implementation: Implement the Backtracking Search Algorithm to systematically explore
and find a solution to the Knight’s Tour for the user-defined board size.

Cultural Algorithm Implementation: Design and integrate a Cultural Algorithm to provide an alternative
solution strategy that fosters diversity and adaptability.
Visualisation: Include a graphical representation of the knight’s movements on the chessboard, aiding
users in understanding and appreciating the solutions generated.
Optimisation: Strive for optimised algorithms to handle larger chessboard sizes efficiently.
This project aims not only to solve the Knight’s Tour problem but also to offer users an engaging, interactive
experience, allowing them to explore the fascinating world of chessboard traversal using advanced algorithms.
